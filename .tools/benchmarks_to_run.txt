Since we don't have a lot of time left for the final submissions, we can 
understand and run only a small subset of the benchmarks. Here is a list of 
some of the easier algorithms in to rodinia benchmark:

RODINIA

d1.  b+trees
d2.  backprop
d3.  bfs
d4.  gaussian
5.  dwt -- SD
6.  hotspot -- SD
7.  hybridsort -- AG
8.  kmeans -- SD
9.  lavaMD -- AG
d10. lud
11. nn -- SD
12. pathfinder -- SD
13. srad_v2 -- SD
14. streamcluster -- SD 

PARBOIL

d1. bfs
d2. lbm
3. mri-q -- AG
d4. stencil
5. sgemm -- AG
d6. spmv
d7. tpacf

These ones are kind of hard, but still doable

RODINIA:

1. leukocyte
2. nw - In this case, understanding the algorithm is harder than understanding
the code
3. particlefilter - naive implementation has around 700 lines of cuda code
4. srad_v1 - too many cuda files (total 790 lines of code). v2 is doable

PARBOIL:

1. cutcp
2. histo
3. sad

Everything else can't be done in the given timeframe. Reasons:

RODINIA:

1. mummergpu - 3786 lines of cuda code
2. myocyte - 5333 lines of cuda code

PARBOIL:

1. mri-gridding - 1327 lines of code
